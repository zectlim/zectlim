Hi, I am Zect Lim. 

Formerly, I am a digital animation artist who worked in creative industry for a decade. 
I was amazed by the capability of coding and took the leap of faith into the journey of the coding.
I am interested in writing codes and designing solutions integrated with the creativity and aesthetic of the art.
